# Sun Dog

Community solar is rolling out in Minnesota in 2016. This is utility program allowing people to subscribe to receive their energy from a solar farm in their community. Many solar developers are working to build these solar projects, but one of the development challenges is to find eligible subscribers. This app aggregates those subscribers, by providing an overview of the opportunity, qualifying subscribers who are interested, and providing a sign-up page that collects all of the information that solar developers need.
